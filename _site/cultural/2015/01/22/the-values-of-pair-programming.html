    <h3 id="what-is-pair-programming">What is pair programming</h3>
<p>Pair programming is exactly what it sounds like two people programming together. Now your probably wondering how the heck does that work. No it is not 1 hand from each person tying on the keyboard or one person watches while the other codes. It is more simply separated in a Driver &amp; Navigator pair.</p>

<p>Just like if you were driving a car and the other was navigating, really nothing different besides we are driving a computer and navigating a program, Ok you got me it is nothing like a road trip! The driver will be the “Typer” meaning he will man the keyboard. The navigator will think of all the logic and tell the driver what to code and where. Remember to reference your code by the line numbers it is impossible for someone who is typing to understand “Change This”. Instead we would say “Change the method name on line 152”. Now that you have an idea of what pair programming is I will explain some pros and cons.</p>

<h3 id="the-difficulties-of-pairing-remote">The difficulties of pairing remote</h3>
<p>Dev Bootcamp has a special phase called Phase 0 which seems to be aprrporiately named since when programming you start counting at 0 and not 1. This portion of DBC is mandatory remote work for 9 weeks and is broken up into to 3 units of 3 weeks. If you have ever tried to learn ruby on your own it is like this but with a forced structure.</p>

<p>DBC requires you to pair at least 2 times a week which is great but I am sure you could imagine how hard this is to manage if you are holding a full time job or have kids.. Luckily for us there is something called a Google Hangout and friendly cohort mates that work with your schedule.</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with hangouts it is similar to Skype(If you don’t know what Skype is, I am not sure why you are reading this). You can share your screen, chat, add fun little effects and more, I mean it’s google what do you expect right?. As fine and dandy as that sounds I am sure you are already thinking of the down falls.</p>

<p>The biggest problems are internet connection and location. When pairing remotely you need to make sure that this is done in a quite and content place which is not always feasible for developers. Some work solely out of coffee shops because their moms basement doesn’t get anything better than 3 mbps or simply just don’t want to pay for internet. So I am sure you could understand how communication can be affected.</p>

<p>From my experience body language is the second most important part of pair or peer programming. It is hard to get a feel for your pairs body language because maybe you can only see their face or their camera is turned off to save bandwidth so on and so forth. You could imagine working on a problem for 2 hours and you guys hit a road block, it has been 20 minutes of just pure scratching each others head. Well with body language you would be able to see that and recommend to take a break for a few minutes and then get back to the problem with a fresh mind.</p>

<p>I think in general pairing remotely is not the best way for this to happen but it works. I will explain how and why it works better than working by yourself in just a brief minute but before I do just know that weather you pair remotely or in person it is a lot more constructive than beating your skull because you cannot solve a problem.</p>

<h3 id="the-reward-of-peer-programming">The reward of peer programming</h3>
<p>Pair programming has a lot more pros than cons in this situation but I will mention only a couple so keep that in mind. The first is the power of learning. When pair programming you never really know what your pairs knowledge base is, he could be a pure ruby logic genius but not know the syntax , he could be a great programmer all around or he could simply just pretend like he knew ruby. Either way you are going to gain some knowledge from your pair.</p>

<p>I find that most times when pairing there is a large amount of ideas bouncing back and forth. Such as “What about the .each method” or “No the .each_with_index will work”. So what of you don’t know what the .each with index method is, your pair should be able to easily explain what this does and how it can be used.</p>

<p>Another scenario is my favorite. You know when you are just starring off into your code hopelessly wondering why this code is not passing the test. You decide “Hey a pair would be great for me right now.” Ryan is online so you ping him, you ask if he would you mind pairing with me when he is free and that I am having an issue. He comes over to your desk to help and immediately points out that you misspelled initialize. If you read my ruby classes post you will know how important this is. You run your test and it passes, way better than having to spend hours re writing methods when they have already worked. As you can see pair programming can be a heart ache but way more of a help than anything. It’s essentially running 2 brains on 1 program and as anybody says 2 is better than 1 right.</p>

<h3 id="the-power-of-feedback">The Power of Feedback</h3>
<p>DBC relies a lot on feedback through he process of phase 0. You are required to give you pair feedback after each session weather you have paired with them before or not. This is not the easiest task as you would think your feedback needs to be in the ASK method meaning “Actionable, Specific and Kind”. The kind part is not so hard and the specific as well but when it comes to the actionable it can sometime get tricky.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-implement-feedback">How to implement feedback</h3>
<p>Implementing feedback is not as easy as it seems. The way DBC provides your feedback is a little weary, meaning that you can’t actually see who led you what feedback so it is up to you to pay attention to who has left feedback and who as not. None the less Feedback is something that anyone in any field can relate to. I specifically implement feedback in what I think is a unique way.</p>

<p>I like to look at each aspect that my pair mentions in their feedback and try to implement a different one each pairing session. After that I look for my pair feedback to see if they noticed any change if they did not mention the implemented point I like to ask in a polite way if I improved in the certain aspect via email.</p>

<p>I find that some people try to implement everything at once but that can sometimes cause more issues in your pairing session. Everyone is a little different so try out your own methods of course this is just on of many options.</p>

<h3 id="providing-solid-feedback">Providing solid feedback</h3>
<p>It is just as important to provide feedback as it is to get feedback. Feedback helps you improve not only as a coder but as an overall person. Giving your pair or any one at that point feedback is no easy task. I have had a chance for my feedback to be rated and I definitely could work on a few aspects myself.</p>

<p>To be honest there are so many great people that I have paired with that I feel it may be a little hard to give them some constructive feedback but I have come to the conclusion if you think about it hard enough there is always something constructive to say weather it is to keep up a good job or you are horrible at pairing.</p>

<p>I prefer myself to take notes during my session so it is a little easier to remember what you did and did not like. Often times I don’t get to leaving my pair feedback till the next day because my brain is just fried from such a hard challenge or maybe even 2 days later cause it slipped my mind. This is where having notes really comes handy especially when you are retaining as much information as a Phase 0 DBC student. Pairing and feedback are no easy task but it is a task that I can seem to appreciate more and more as time goes on.</p>
