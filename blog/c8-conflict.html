              Conflict is something everyone in the world will encounter at some point and time in their life. The hardest part for most people is resolving the conflict or figuring out why conflict is so apparent in their life. I am not particularly a conflicted person, of course I have conflicts but not as much as some people with a more fixed mindset my be. Conflicts can really help you grow as a person if you look at the positive in them and not the negative.

              Most of my conflicts in life were either with my now fiancee or with my parents when going through school. For the sake of my sanity maybe we will talk about a personal conflict outside of the commonalities. I want to talk about a more professional conflict at work and I will give you a quick background.

              I am a eCommerce Manager for a business by the name of <a href=“//techeyes.com”>TechEyes.com</a> and I am #2 in the hierarchy of the business so you could imagine how much gets put on my shoulders. I do anything from sales -> marketing -> Web Development. Lucky for me my boss and I don’t have to many conflicts with each other. There was one specific conflict recently that I would use as an example and it happened to be about fraudulent orders.
            </p>

            <p>
              We noticed in 2013 fraud orders had really gone up on out website so we went after a change in company policy and I got to design this change being the person who manages all the sales. So we instituted this policy and just about a month ago we had a metting for the year end. Well endless to say we had a good amount of fraud orders still but where the conflict started is when he said “Well we have this X much lost from fraud orders”. I politely asked what the total amount od potentials so what percentage of the saved ones are the completed ones and he said “That was not the point”. I was irritated because I was not looking to show them anything better yet I new I needed to do a better job but could not gauge how good of a job I had been doing in the past.
            </p>

            <p>
              I felt a little under appreciated after this needless to say because he made no efforts to comfort me for these losses and we argued for about 10 minutes about what each of us meant by this. I did forget to mention there is a language barrier between us since he has only been in the states for about 5 years now. Unfortunately the resolution of this conflict was not one in the same for a lot of people.

            <p>
              I started by just agreeing with what he was saying because I could see there was no 2 ways about what he was thinking, which is fine he is the boss but only if you can live with that. After everything cooled down I simply asked him if and when he had time if he could provide me the total number of potential fraud orders and I would do everything else myself. It was not to prove him wrong by any means yet to understand how much harder I should be working towards this and help myself grow. I still to this day have not received it but that is also beyond my care at this point. I just let it pass and continued running the business.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are a lot of other ways to resolve conflicts but with this particular situation it makes it tough because they pay your bills and you are there most likely 5 days a week. If I could go back in this situation I probably wouldn’t have asked this question and just used the gauge of I didn’t do a good enough job not to hear about it so I need to work harder on protecting fraud orders and continue my work. I learned in business that it is not always about having an accurate resolution to your problems but a way to ave both parties put it behind them because if you have a constant conflict with people at work you will quickly grow to hate your job and the people who surround you most of your week. If that is the case there is a very likely chance that it will fall into your home and that is the last thingI want to happen.
