        Dev Bootcamp is exactly what it sounds like and not at the same time. I truly think it as a mix between web development (Code) &amp; general life enhancment. I just paid $12,000 to have people who know so much more about this industry pound knowledge into my head and leave me be 19 weeks later to forget everything I learned! Well I was far from correct. DBC is going to take care of you before, during and post cohort and it makes me that much more excited to meet more of the staff and fellow Sea Lions 2015. The people that attend DBC have a very common interest and you have the opportunity to teach eachother for the next 19 weeks and the rest of your life. Since high school has ended it seems that friends are far and few but with DBC I think we will all make lifetime friends and genuine relationships.

        When I first discovered Dev Bootcamp I was reading an article on Techcrunch with the title of something like "Man spends 9 weeks &amp; $12,000 to make $77,000 a year 3 months later". Intriguing right well with my concrete sequential style of  thinking I immediately made a plan for DBC. It took me about 6 months and a lot of watching acceptance videos to feel comfortable applying. I was happy to be accepted in Nov of 2013 and set a cohort date for that following April. Unfortunately due to finances I had to change my cohort date but feel like I can put 100% more effort without thinking of money constanly. This brings me to Prep and Phase 0.

        The week before Phase 0 was when it really hit. The nerves really started to set in after I finalized my payment and got the pre phase 0 (prep) tasks completed! Friday 12/5/14 is when we saw our fist Google+ community post and I quickly started to look it over and boy oh boy was I intimidated and the sweat starts to bead down my forehead. Dev Bootcamp does a great job at explaining each and every detail to make these challenges as clear as possible. I have a very clear understanding of what to expect from DBC and can't wait to start Phase 0 Week 2.
