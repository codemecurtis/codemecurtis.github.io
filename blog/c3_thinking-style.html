      As a concrete sequential thinker it is very hard to steer away from my plan. I like to think staright forward and in a pre planned process. As some will say I like to have a plan for a plan but that is just them. Now your probably wondering where is this genious even getting his information from well it's from a gentlmen by the name of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Gregorc">Anthony Gregorc.</a>

      He is known for his outstanding knowledge and work in learning styles. He started his career back in 1969 with the introduction of his Energic Model of Styles. This is Anthony's direct explaination of each learning style.

    <ul class="learning-styles">
      <li>
        <strong>Concrete:</strong> This quality enables you to register information directly through your five senses: sight, smell, touch, taste, and hearing. When you are using your concrete ability, you are dealing with the obvious, the "here and now." You are not looking for hidden meanings, or making relationships between ideas or concepts. <i>"It is what it is."</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> This quality allows you to visualize, to conceive ideas, to understand or believe that which you cannot actually see. When you are using your abstract quality, you are using your intuition, your imagination, and you are looking beyond “what is” to the more subtle implications. <i>"It is not always what it seems."</i>
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Sequential:</strong> Allows your mind to organize information in a linear, step-by-step manner. When using your sequential ability, you are following a logical train of thought, a traditional approach to dealing with information. You may also prefer to have a plan and to follow it, rather than relying on impulse.
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Random:</strong> Lets your mind organize information by chunks, and in no particular order. When you are using your random ability, you may often be able to skip steps in a procedure and still produce the desired result. You may even start in the middle, or at the end, and work backwards. You may also prefer your life to be more impulsive, or spur of the moment, than planned.

    </ul>

      My experience through Dev Bootcamp has been that and more. I went from knowing a lot about git, HTML &amp; CSS to not know anything! During our holiday break I worked so much that I definetly burnt myself out and had to really work hard to get back in the groove for week 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think my mindest both helps and hurts. Having a plan of action for most of the week really helps me to focus on which days for which challenges. When you are working on your "own" it is very important for you to have a plan if you did then "winging" it probably won't get the job done. If it works for you great but for me I would have a hard time. This leads me to the hard time however because when I am making that plan I tend to over think it a little and try to space tasks out with appropriate breaks.

      The sequential part of this also has a downfall. In that it makes it harder to see what it can be instead of what it is like what Gregorc stated earlier. This can harm you especially in coding because you need to have a strong idea of what it will be, often times you will not have a starting point which will lead to you having a very hard time seeing what it will be and starting the project. My speculation is someone with this kind of learning style and mindset created wireframes but that is merely a thought. It was much easier to over come this than it is the sequential part but most people have some kind of abstract thoughts in stilled them.
    </p>
    <p>
      However this can you hurt you because we all know that when planning you need to have a very good idea of how long a task will take. Leaving me some what high and dry when I take longer than expected on a certain challenge. Remember when I told you <i>I don't like to deviate from my plan</i> well this is contributing greatly to this happeneing. I have noticed in the first unit of phase 0 that you can't plan every move for the week. But I have come to a conlusion that I can plan each day with a supportive flexibility. I am actually using this method starting week 4 of DBC which started today. I will be sure to come back with an update ffor you guys to tell you how that has helped or hurt.

      There are 2 main mindsets and those are Growth and Fixed. They vary hugely in their differences. So let me see if I can relate this to you any any way to help understand exactly what I am talking about, since we are coding here I will try to relate them. So have you ever been coding a feature you have worked very hard on and then you ask for some ones opinion or you submit a pull request and you see or hear the words what about.... This is where the mindsets come into play. Your friend tells you hey so they have these HTML5 tags like <code>header, footer, section, aside and a whole bunch more</code> you should really start using those, it is 2015 right?
    </p>
    <p>
      A growth mindest would imediately take these into consideration and use them in future projects, releases, job whatever suites you. Fixed mindset would strictly use their method they aren't really open to learning something that you can do but what should be done, I used those terms because I don't want to say you can think this way and do it but you will have a harder time and would have to find a method that works for you.
