                  <p>My name is Curtis Seaton, I live in the sunny bay area. My early experience with coding started in High school with the launch of Myspace, I would spend my free time after school and on weekends customizing layouts for friends using HTMl and inline CSS.</p>

                    <div class="summary">Today I started my journey to further my web developer career by diving into building rich and beautiful web applications. Phase 0 started on Monday 12/8/14 and we got introuduced to Git, Github &amp; More. As a developer we are always going to be writing code that looks a bit odd to the human eye. Just for starters Git can make code a little more understandable to someone who has never coded or is not familiar with your code. Git also keeps a snapshot of the code changes in a desierd document or set of documents and folders with a easy to read title and description of the change.<br>

                      Dev Bootcamp is exactly what it sounds like and not at the same time. I truly think it as a mix between web development (Code) &amp; general life enhancment. I just paid $12,000 to have people who know so much more about this industry pound knowledge into my head and leave me be 19 weeks later to forget everything I learned! Well I was far from correct. DBC is going to take care of you before, during and post cohort and it makes me that much more excited to meet more of the staff and fellow Sea Lions 2015. The people that attend DBC have a very common interest and you have the opportunity to teach eachother for the next 19 weeks and the rest of your life. Since high school has ended it seems that friends are far and few but with DBC I think we will all make lifetime friends and genuine relationships.<br>
