          <p>Conflict is something everyone in the world will encounter at some point and time in their life. The hardest part for most people is resolving the conflict or figuring out why conflict is so apparent in their life. I am not particularly a conflicted person, of course I have conflicts but not as much as some people with a more fixed mindset my be. Conflicts can really help you grow as a person if you look at the positive in them and not the negative.</p>

          <p><a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React.JS</a> is an open-source JavaScript library that was built by our friends over at Facebook. They took years of failing their UI (User Interface) on both desktop and mobile applications when it came to rendering data to the user alas react. React is the V (View) in MVC (Model View Controller) it is not an entire language or framework like Angular or Backbone.</p>

          <p>After spending the last 4 weeks (6 if you count our break) studying the ins and out’s of Ruby, DBC introduced the almighty Javascript or ECMAScript for you vintage coders. I have very little prior experience with JavaScript typically I push this off to my freelance developers in my current position but none the less I still learned a lot. I first learned that there is in fact 2 names for JavaScript as I mentioned before, whether any ones uses the latter option is beyond me but hey it is still learning right ?! Ruby and JavaScript have a lot of the same  methods/functions and syntactically look similar with some small changes. My job is to show you those changes and we will start by working with Ruby Hashes and JavaScript Objects.</p>

<p>Stereotype Threat in the simplest definition is the affect of someone who is worried about the way others may look at them because of a couple different reasons. The most common reason is going to be the color of your skin, this has been apparent in our day to day life for over a 100 years. Better put by Dr. Claude Steele “ The threat of being viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype or the fear of doing something that would inadvertently confirm that stereotype. ”</p>

<p>Pair programming is exactly what it sounds like two people programming together. Now your probably wondering how the heck does that work. No it is not 1 hand from each person tying on the keyboard or one person watches while the other codes. It is more simply separated in a Driver &amp; Navigator pair.</p>

          <p>It seems to be the obvious for me now a days but almost everything in Ruby is an object or <code>Object</code>. All Object-Oriented languages use them so if you have prior experience with Java you may understand easier than others. Add ruby classes is not different than an object. I am sure in the enumerable methods post last week you work paying close attention to the <code>.group_by</code> well have you ever wondered how in the heck you can call this on an object. If you answered yes then great we will move forward with the learning (Those who said no can hit the “I hate this” button below to exit). A Ruby class is a collection of variables, methods and their specific behaviors. In the next couple of paragraphs I will “Lay down the law” for classes.</p>

          <p>I remember sometime about a year ago I was reading a story about how @Twiiter wasn’t meeting the global standards for minorites and it gave me that much more of a push to make a change for this. As of now there is only 6.1 percent of the industry which is a underrepresented women or minority says <a href="http://www.insightintodiversity.com/">Insight to Diversity</a>. There are many ways to change this but the only way it is going to last is by teaching our youth how important the tech industry is not only now but in the future.</p>

          <p>Enumerable is simply a collection of methods that iterate through a collection of objects and run the following block. I am sure that went over your head so let me break it down for you. Lets start with iterating this is the act of separating each element and providing it an action is what is called a block. I will give you an example.</p>
