  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I remember sometime about a year ago I was reading a story about how @Twiiter wasn’t meeting the global standards for minorites and it gave me that much more of a push to make a change for this. As of now there is only 6.1 percent of the industry which is a underrepresented women or minority says <a href="http://www.insightintodiversity.com/">Insight to Diversity</a>. There are many ways to change this but the only way it is going to last is by teaching our youth how important the tech industry is not only now but in the future.</p>

<h3 id="top-universities-turn-out-black-and-hispanic-computer-science-and-computer-engineering-graduates-at-twice-the-rate-that-leading-technology-companies-hire-them">“Top universities turn out black and Hispanic computer science and computer engineering graduates at twice the rate that leading technology companies hire them.”</h3>

<p>I can’t say exactly what the problem is because it would be complete speculation but having done some research it seems that even the “qualified” minorities with the proper degrees are not getting hired. From my understanding in order to compete and prosper in the industry you need a minimum amount of minorites as required by the Equal opportunity employer group. There are twice as many minority graduates then there are actually being hired. This is very off putting for the young adult looking for a new career becuase he automatically get’s the feeling it will be “too hard to find a job”. I don’t know about you but when I was coming out of high school I had an idea that I wanted to be in the tech industry and was discouraged by many stories like these.</p>

<p>Luckily for me my dad is a very successful telecommunications engineer. This was a great influence for me to make the long stride into the industry. In order to make this possible not only do we need more tech engineers, support and general employees but we need to own more of the busineeses. If it is true that business managers, executives and owners are not hiring because of “personal reasons” then if minorities own more tech related business there won’t be as much spectulation on this issue.</p>

<p>There is also the issue of the minorities not picking this path for their career. With only 12% of U.S. colleges having minorties graduate with a CS degree it is hard to make an impact into the industry. As humans not everyone is equipped for this “type” of job. If we had more minorites graducting with a CS degree we may see an increase in high-end talent which is what the top tech companies are looking for. We cannot put all the blame on the fact that they are not hiring minorties but that more of them need to have qualified education in order to fit in.</p>

<p>Now I don’t want anyone to think from this article that I am subject to exactly everything I have stated. I used multiple resources such as the silicon valley newspaper, USA today and others. I can’t stress enough how much the act of influence will help this industry. I hope that one day once I get settled into the industry that I will be able to provide a wide influence for our minority youth in the tech industry. Having help with mom-profit orginizations in other industries I think it is something that we are just missing in the early stages of my youth. In all it is a 2 sided battle that will hopefully change in the coming years and if I can be apart of this, It would be my pleasure.</p>
