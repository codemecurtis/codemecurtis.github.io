    <p>Accomplishment - 3 Confidence - 5 Credibility - 3 Control - 4 Growth - 5 Will-Power - 5 Money - 5</p>

<h3 id="values">Values</h3>

<p>Values are important to almost anyone in this world from a bum on the street to the most successful people in the world like Elon Musk and Warren Buffett. I am going to talk a little bit about Will-power, it is a very important value the I strictly believe in.</p>

<p>During Phase 0 I have used a lot of will-power, I have been working 40-46 and having to do 15-25 hours worth of at home work has taken nothing but will-power and determination. This does not only pertain to DBC however. In the day-to-day life will-power is needed, for people who want to loose weight, learn a new skill that is not in a traditional education system.</p>

<p>As a manager in my current position I get asked questions for advice on a daily. My most common question being in the eCommerce sales business is confidence. In order to succeed in a sales environment or any life environment at that fact confidence plays a big part! I try to show confidence in everything that I do and I am always happy to help another person with their own confidence.</p>

<p>Stereotype threat if you hadnâ€™t read last weeks post is a situational predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their social group. I am sure you could understand how confidence, growth and will-power can play a big part in overcoming stereotype threat.</p>

<p>Confidence is one of the most important aspects of affirming stereotype threat. Next I would say will power to overcome some of those fears. When dealing with stereotype threat you need to have confidence in yourself wether you are trying to fit in at school or in the work place, if you do not walk with confidence people will see that in your body language.</p>

<p>In some scenarios people may put in the situation of them trying to tell you that you are living up to a negative stereotype and this is one way that confidence and mostly will power will help you overcome this. You have to have strong will power to power through just about any obstacle in life but when you have people holding you back you have to understand that just because they are telling you one thing it does not always mean they are accurate.</p>

<p>When over coming these obstacles you may or may not realize that you are growing. To overcome any step of stereotype threat causes you to grow in some shape, way or form. Growing in life is something that you do on a daily basis and have done since your birth. People can grow in height, weight, heart etc. If you have a fixed mindset it will make it very tough to overcome stereotype threat. Just remember if you are having a hard time with it you have to take a step back and try to implement confidence, will-power and growth.</p>
