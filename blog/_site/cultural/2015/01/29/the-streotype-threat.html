    <h3 id="what-is-stereotype-threat">What is Stereotype threat?</h3>
<p>Stereotype Threat in the simplest definition is the affect of someone who is worried about the way others may look at them because of a couple different reasons. The most common reason is going to be the color of your skin, this has been apparent in our day to day life for over a 100 years. Better put by Dr. Claude Steele “ The threat of being viewed through the lens of a negative stereotype or the fear of doing something that would inadvertently confirm that stereotype. ”</p>

<p>Stereotype threat is widely seen in black males and females but is not subject just to this scenario. Your average Asian kid could be scared of not succeeding at math because of the stereotype that all Asians are good at math. This is just plain out wrong, all humans are what we call capable human beings. This is the first understanding that when your parents tell you that “You can do anything you put your mind too” is true! It is all on yourself to not fall in stereotypes and make your best effort to succeed in what you love or want to do.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-others-see-stereotype-threat">How do others see Stereotype threat?</h3>
<p>People have the right to believe what they want but stereotypes were created by people who have a huge lack of understanding. If everyone of a certain kind does the something would you refer it as normal or stereotype, that is truly the question you should be asking yourself. If you answered with a stereotype maybe you simply want to grab a book and read about this before finalizing that statement.</p>

<p>I have noticed that a lot of people tend to look at people suffering from stereotype threat as less productive people, un motivated or lacking in education. This is simply incorrect. Stereotype threat can cause many issues not only in the workplace but in your own personal life as well.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-give-actionable-feedback">How to give actionable feedback</h3>
<p>Stereotype threat is something that will most likely be around for years to come but we can only do our best to help the situation and just like most things in life feedback is a great beginning. If you remember from my last post feedback is not constructive for everyone, people tend to look at feedback in only a negative way which is a huge no-no.</p>

<p>In order to give good feedback we will refer to Dev Bootcamp’s acronym, A.S.K meaning your feedback is Actionable, Specific and Kind. Kind and nice are 2 different things and here is a great example.</p>

<h4 id="kind">Kind:</h4>
<p>Your shoes are really nice, but I think you could use an upgrade.</p>

<h4 id="nice">Nice:</h4>
<p>Your shoes are really nice, I love them so much, you are the greatest’s person ever for having those shoes.
You can see here that the person who was nice never really gave anything constructive in their sentence or feedback. There is simply no room for improvement or direction of improvement from being nice. Now don’t get me wrong I am not saying don’t be nice but you have to look at the harsh reality of things and that is “No one is perfect”.</p>

<p>When you realize someone if falling into the stereotype threat your best bet is to first ask them why they are feeling this way and help to reassure their insecurities with kind words. Just remember feedback is not a thing for harm but for help, in tech especially!</p>

<h3 id="what-does-it-feel-like">What does it feel like?</h3>
<p>I can definitely tell you that I have experienced this personally, as a half black half white young man with tattoos it is a little hard not to, unless you do something about it. I experienced this a lot in my younger teen years. When I was first trying to decide what i wanted to do with my life I had always had a liking to computers and started building my own and learning them. With my dad being in the industry I probably should have exercised the resource a little more earlier on but that is the past.</p>

<p>I always felt because i was a young black adult that I would have a much harder time to find a job in an industry mostly filled with whites and asians. I quickly got discouraged and started pursuing more stereotype life style hanging around with the wrong crowd and all I was doing was contributing to the stereotype threat I was experiencing. That lasted for a few years and when I made the final wrong choice and got myself put away for sometime is really what helped me to change this mindset.</p>

<p>When you are in a place that is filled with a lot of stereotypes you either fit in or you find your true self and that is exactly what happened to me. I realized this lifestyle was not for me and could not even explain to myself, why I was choosing this path. This is when my dad got much more involved in the situation. I never really till now realized what was happening but now that i know what Stereotype threat is I can understand that is what i was experiencing.</p>

<p>I started asking my dad much more questions about how he did especially in his time because his early years blacks were in a much lower class and looked at a lot more negative then before. He said “ I just worked hard!” as simple as that sounded he has always explained this to me. Only you can let other people give you distractions. He told me to look at my white side if I am having trouble with this because the more you let this affect you then the less opportunities you will have.</p>

<p>Needless to say this was not the only conversation I had with my father but because I made a wrong decision it was little easier for me to overcome this derogatory thought. I quickly continued my path of building computers and learned that I did not want to do this my entire life and look at me now! Succeeding at Dev Bootcamp and on a great path to make a huge impact in the industry.</p>
