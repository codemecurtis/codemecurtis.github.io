                          Enumerable is simply a collection of methods that iterate through a collection of objects and run the following block. I am sure that went over your head so let me break it down for you. Lets start with iterating this is the act of separating each element and providing it an action is what is called a block. I will give you an example.
                        </p>
                      <pre>
                        <code>
                          arr = ["Hello", "World", "He is crazy", "Wait", "What"] <br>
                          arr.each { |element| puts element }
                        </code>

                          I remember sometime about a year ago I was reading a story about how @Twiiter wasn't meeting the global standards for minorites and it gave me that much more of a push to make a change for this. As of now there is only 6.1 percent of the industry which is a underrepresented women or minority says <a href="http://www.insightintodiversity.com/">Insight to Diversity</a>. There are many ways to change this but the only way it is going to last is by teaching our youth how important the tech industry is not only now but in the future.

                          As a concrete sequential thinker it is very hard to steer away from my plan. I like to think staright forward and in a pre planned process. As some will say I like to have a plan for a plan but that is just them.

                          Arrays and hashes are a lot a like. Essentially they hold certain values for access in your code for starters. Once I tell you the purpose of arrays and hashes I will explain how we can utilize these to our advantage and what the differences are.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>
                          Arrays can contain multiple different values such as strings, integers and even other arrays. Those arrays inside of arrays are considered sub arrays, pretty clever right? Your probably thinking well what how do I use these values or even sperate them. Vey good question and below you will see example 1.1(Empty Hash) and 1.2(Standard Hash).

                      <div class="summary">Today I started my journey to further my web developer career by diving into building rich and beautiful web applications. Phase 0 started on Monday 12/8/14 and we got introuduced to Git, Github &amp; More. As a developer we are always going to be writing code that looks a bit odd to the human eye. Just for starters Git can make code a little more understandable to someone who has never coded or is not familiar with your code. Git also keeps a snapshot of the code changes in a desierd document or set of documents and folders with a easy to read title and description of the change.<br>

                        Dev Bootcamp is exactly what it sounds like and not at the same time. I truly think it as a mix between web development (Code) &amp; general life enhancment. I just paid $12,000 to have people who know so much more about this industry pound knowledge into my head and leave me be 19 weeks later to forget everything I learned! Well I was far from correct. DBC is going to take care of you before, during and post cohort and it makes me that much more excited to meet more of the staff and fellow Sea Lions 2015. The people that attend DBC have a very common interest and you have the opportunity to teach eachother for the next 19 weeks and the rest of your life. Since high school has ended it seems that friends are far and few but with DBC I think we will all make lifetime friends and genuine relationships.<br>

                      <div class="summary">
                        CSS is a very important part of building a website. The CSS is like the interior design of your house what good is a house without paint, shingles, a ceiling etc. if you ask me it is not very good at all but some people are different. Today I am going to explain exactly when and how to use ID's or Classes in your HTML. before I begin about that I feel the need to explain why we add these to the HTML and not the CSS file. CSS uses a very easy way to connect to HTML through something called a link. A link tells the HTML to use "This file" for it's CSS.
