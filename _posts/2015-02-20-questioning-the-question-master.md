Asking questions is some thing everyone see's as a natural thing, you shouldn't have to ask a question in order to ask your originall question but some times you know what you are talking about but other's whom you are asking may not understand. There are a couple important parts to asking a good question. Have you ever asked a question and the persons response is "I am sorry I don't understand." There could be a couple dfferent reasons for this.

-1. Did you leave enough information.
-2. Did you use technical terms that they did not understand

What I like to do is some thing like TDD (Test Driven-Development). I ask myself what kind of answer I want to hear, maybe I don't know the exact answer but I have a good idea of what I want to hear so I gather all the information they would need in order to receive a correct answer. Obviously this isn't the only way to ask the right question just one way. 


If you are askingquestions via the internet it is that more important you have an appropriate title. To many times have I seen a question that said "Can't get webpage to load" not only is this the broadest title possible but no one is likely to looka t your question because 1 they will fear the worst explination or it will not be as benifical to the guy who titled his post "Moved to new server and webpage won't load anymore." This would appeal to someone with server knowledge a much more healthy title and I would be glad to take a look for someone who spent time writing the question then just throwing some thing up there hoping for an answer. Let's take a look at a couple examples of good and bad questions.


*Title:* How can I make a redirect page?

*Content:* How can I redirect the user from one page to another using jQuery?

This to me looks like a bad question yet it has a ton of answers so maybe it isn't the best option but let's see if we can expand this question. I would first mention my web project and the languages I am currently using because someone could easily offer a better option not using jQuery but to each is own.



*Title:* I need to redirect my users form one page to another with jQuery but getting an error {name of the error}

*Content:* I am workjing on a project with ruby on rails and I am trying to redirect a user from the login page to the account page after login. I have the login portion but it is not properly redirecting my user to the account page:

"Here is my code"" or "I don't know where to start"

Going back to the fact that they had so many answers to this question it may go to show how many questions or options there are from being to broad. When asking a more direct question you can expect to get a more accurate answer with less tries. It looks here that there was 40 initital comments on his code even after and answer had been posted.

Asking questions in person is a little easier then asking them virtually because you can get instant feedback and have a nice back and forth before you get the actual answerthat you were looking for. For me I find that asking tehe question in person is the easiest way to get practice answering a good question. If you ever find yourself saying "why did I ask this question, like this" you should go back, re-read your question, see if there is anymore details that need to be solved and from there you can update your question.
