Today was definetly an experience. We spent most of the day reviewing the rules, structure and how things generally work in DBC. First thing I can say is there is definetly a support system for you and they enforece this over and over again. When we first arrived we were told to meet in the lobby and all the sudden here comes a whole bunch of phase 2 students and mentors, we can use them all throught the rest of their time in the program.

We started by a fun DBC tradition, I didn't cath the name if it had one but I definetly felt a little out of my element. It was a nice way to get settled in. We did these kinds of things up until around noon 30 and had some almight lunch!

After lunch yet another talk yet a little more focused on the rules and cirrculum for Phase 1. We learned how to submit mour work for the review by the teachers, it is actually pretty damn cool since this is how it will be for us in the "Real World". Finally 3:15 rolls around and we get to some god damn code, I mean this is what we are here for right? The challenge were actually not much more demanding then the phase 0 work that we were doing, but I had a great pair who helped me power through this!

It's now 8:55 PM and I am 2 stops away from my station on bart, my pair and I were eager to finish the challenge so we stayed till just before 8 which is fair considering we have 9 weeks of this intense program! I will leave you guys with a note of advice, If you want to learn programming go to Dev Bootcamp they are not there only to teach you how to code but how to be a better learner, health nut and most mportantly a better human being!
