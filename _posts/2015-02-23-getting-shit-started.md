Today was definetly an experience. We spent most of the day reviewing the rules, structure and how things generally work in DBC. First thing I can say is there is definetly a support system for you and they enforce this over and over again. When we first arrived we were told to meet in the lobby and all the sudden here comes a whole bunch of phase 2 students and mentors, we can use them all throughout the rest of our time in the program.

We started by a fun DBC tradition, I didn't cath the name, if it had one but I definetly felt a little out of my element. It was a nice way to get settled in. We would go around the room and state 4 facts.

-1. Our name
-2. What brought us to DBC
-3. A quirk about ourself
-4. Something you love

 It was fun because Phase 1 & 2 would alternate yet Phase 2 just had to say their name and then give us a tweet size bit of advice to get through the program. We did these kinds of things up until around noon 30 and had some almighty lunch! Today is one of the few days they provide lunch and breakfast. Typically it is only during graduation ay that this will happen!

After lunch yet another talk yet a little more focused on the rules and cirrculum for Phase 1. We learned how to submit our work for the review by the teachers, it is actually pretty damn cool since this is how it will be for us in the "Real World". Finally 3:15 rolls around and we get to some god damn code, I mean this is what we are here for right? The challenge were actually not much more demanding then the phase 0 work that we were doing, but I had a great pair who helped me power through this!

It's now 8:55 PM and I am 2 stops away from my station on bart, my pair and I were eager to finish the challenge so we stayed till just before 8 which is fair considering we have 9 weeks of this intense program! I will leave you guys with a note of advice, If you want to learn programming go to Dev Bootcamp they are not there only to teach you how to code but how to be a better learner, health nut and most mportantly a better human being!
