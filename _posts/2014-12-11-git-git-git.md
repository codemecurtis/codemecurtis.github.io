Today I started my journey to further my web developer career by diving into building rich and beautiful web applications. Phase 0 started on Monday 12/8/14 and we got introuduced to Git, Github &amp; More. As a developer we are always going to be writing code that looks a bit odd to the human eye. Just for starters Git can make code a little more understandable to someone who has never coded or is not familiar with your code. Git also keeps a snapshot of the code changes in a desierd document or set of documents and folders with a easy to read title and description of the change. It also helps makes it easy to collaborate with other developers in the industry and not step on each others toes because git will never erase a change without asking you! Git is most widely used in the command line or terminal but there are quite a few GUI's (Graphical User Interfaces) that you can use to help you make your way around things.


Simply put Git is a life saver, I can tell you from personal experience. Let's say we are strolling down the street minding our business when this big cloud with lightning stricts your laptop and fries your hard drive (can you tell this is no longer real?). What to do? You just spent the past 8 hours working on a new feature and never uploaded via boring FTP. This is when you enlist <a href="http://github.com">Github.com</a> becuase even if you were using git and didn't have it on a remote (I learned this as well) repository somewhere it is gone! Github is a safe and secure location to save your git repo and allows other developers to view, question, and contribute to your work.

As a newborn DBC Seal Lion I feel like I am really just learning what exactly my feet can do let alone how to crawl or walk! There is some much knowledge packed in these Phaso 0 challenges and I couldn't be more excited. We learned not only about Git this week but we also learned how to use the command line, how to use Github &amp; Twitter and probably the most important to me was how to manage time and become a better overall human. I look forward to all of the cd3oe, lifestyle and mistakes in this very near future and can't wait to meet all of my fellow Sea Lions.
